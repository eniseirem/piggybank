## About PiggyBank

<i>The Smart Piggy Bank</i> is a system for at home usage and it aims to provide a full package of product from it’s Smart Bank to it’s Smart Piggy Bank website and a fun experience of saving money to users. The system contains three modules, the hardware module aims to be able to let users make transaction via it’s sliding plate and the visual processing module is aims to detect the coins that thrown on the plate via visual processing algorithms. After detecting the coin, the software module aims to take these informations via HTTP API, record these transaction informations (informations like timestamp, failed transaction etc.)  in a database and query it back to the user via a website. 

This report will give details about only the software module of the system. The module contains a User Interface Layer (a website for users implemented with PHP Laravel) and a Database Layer (for recording the data and implemented with MYSQL).
Our results of testing showed that we managed to design and implemented a system which is useful for users, efficient, fast and meet the criterion both on the interface and database layers. As much as we wanted to have real data coming from the hardware of the system, due to some failures that aren’t caused because of our team, this part of the system failed. But we worked with program that imitates the data as if it is the real data coming from the hardware and with that we proved that our module can work perfectly with the system if the other parts of the system was working as intended.
